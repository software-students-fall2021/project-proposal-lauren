### What and why?
As students of a school that already lacks a campus and after having been through a global pandemic thatâ€™s kept all of us at home, it would be natural for us to assume that the new school year brings with it a plethora of hope and joy but also much adversity for those who have yet to step on school grounds. Looking back upon our own years at NYU, it is without a doubt that many of us have had trouble acclimating to a new and somewhat daunting environment that is NYC. As an act of sheer charity and good will, we wish to provide guidance on where students can find recipes, grocery stores, and even restaurantes that offer products at a relatively affordable price and a platform through which returning students can help those who are stepping into NYC for the first time.

### For whom?
For NYU students, professors, and faculty who live, attend classes, or spend time around NYU's Manhattan campus. Right now the app would be focused on a specific area/neighborhood, but in the future could be expanded to more areas and the general public. 

### How?
The app will contain two main features:
1. A social media/sharing platform. This platform is where users can post recipes, items they bought from local grocery stores, food from local restaurants, or anything else they want to share. The social media side of the app will also feature topics that students can discuss in a forum-like area. Sample topics include: Street Food, Bubble Tea, Italian food, 3-ingredient meals, et cetera. 

2. A map to show NYU community-made reviews / threads / Street Food carts / grocery stores (any store with a geodata). 

For both parts of the app, users will be able to filter by what they want to see at that moment: certain food groups, recipes, restaurants, specific cuisines (e.g. Japanese, Italian, etc.), accomodate for allergies, price-points, and more. 

### Scope
This project splits into two main functionalities: the map view, and the social-media view.  A well-designed database can provide for both views, as each social media post will be tagged with geo-data. The map will be integrated with available APIs (such as deck.gl or Google Maps), which would remove the need to implement it from scratch. The relative simplicity of CRUD (Create-Read-Update-Delete) operations and the intuitive social-media style user interface will make this project appropriate for the 14-week course.
